## Instructions

This is a classic arcade game based off of the classic game Frogger.  In order to begin start the game, open the folder containing the Arcade Game.  Next, open index.html in your browser and have your fingers placed on the arrow keys to prepare for the game.  

In this game, there is one player and a set of enemies that include bugs.  The goal of the game is to have the player reach the water without colliding or coming in contact with any of the enemies.  The player is allowed to move left, right, up, and down using the arrow keys.  The bugs / enemies move at varying speeds on the paved block portion of the game.  Once a the player collides with the enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the starting square in which they began.  Once the player reaches the water, the player has won the game!  Good luck. 

Refresh the browser when the game is won to play again!

Thanks for taking the time to contribute.  This particular game project utilizes the game loop functionlity, which draws the initial game board onto the screen, calls the update, and then rendor methods on the player and enemy objects.  This is merely an object-oriented javascript project and it is a project that I am required to write on my own.  However, please feel free to use your best judgment and feel free to propose any changles to this document!
